# WeatherDashboard

# Application

For this assignment we were tasked with building a website that allowed a user to search the current weather conditions for a city of their choosing.

When submitting a search for a city the user is then presented with the conditions of that given city as well as the forecast for the following five days.

The information presented to the user covers the current temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and UV Index for that given city.

The user's searches are then stored in a list where they can easily reference that city's forecast by clicking on the city within the list.
